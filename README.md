# ToDos

This is my very first fullstack app and as such there are many open issues and opportuities to improve the code, such as state management (e.g with redux), user auth (today I would use JWT & Redux and not only cokkies with a sessions db), refactore against DRY, ES6 and functional components, design improvements.
